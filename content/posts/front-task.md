4. To make changes, you can create a new branch by running the following git command, and edit files

```Bash
git checkout -b branch-name
```

5. To edit home page content, or change some configs, edit hugo.yaml. For example, you can change the text and images of the index page by editing the respective paragraph content, or change the image link.
6. To edit blog content, like adding new articles or editing existing articles, add or edit markdown files under content/posts.
7. The content changes will be reflected immediately in the local environment, if you don't stop hugo server. If you think the content is OK, you can commit the changes, push to the remote, and create a pull request (PR).
8. Once the changes are reviewed and approved, you can merge the PR into the main branch, and the CI job will automatically update the website in a few seconds to minutes. You can view the updated website at https://yival.io.

Tada! That's all the steps you need to update the YiVal website! Congratulations and looking forward to your contributions!
