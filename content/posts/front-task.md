# Yival Tutorial

We provide some easy-to-use demos for you to directly experience the effect
of Yival in the README on Github.

## Startup Company Headline Generation ðŸ¤–

<!-- google colab:[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EiWUL8rE_kfNLXVPowCWCh6hwHFagvs_?usp=sharing) -->

-   google colab: [headline_generation_colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EiWUL8rE_kfNLXVPowCWCh6hwHFagvs_?usp=sharing)
-   notebook : [headline_generation](./headline_generation.ipynb)

The goal of this demo is to generate corresponding page headlines based on the
names of startup companies. YiVal supports automatic generation of related prompts
and test data according to this goal, and self-evaluation based on the configured
evaluator. It provides different result selection methods such as AHP to confirm
the final result.

For how to confirm the prompt used by the generator, we recommend using a
step-by-step optimization pipeline mode, continuously adjusting based on
the test case results. We provide an example : [pipeline_prompt_generation](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tr5s_adAPmI9Mv6Zz97JnTGIh3mGojsi?usp=sharing)
